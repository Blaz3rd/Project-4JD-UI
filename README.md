# Project-4JD-UI
A Console UI for bedrock! (Credit to CrisXolt for porting this UI pack.)

Original Ideas by:
- 4J Studios
- Hawf-Human
- Keida-Kun
- AgentMindStorm

## NOTE
This pack was designed by CrisXolt, all work goes to him. I only added new features and fixed some bugs that were here since 1.9.0 version
of Bedrock.

## Features
New stuff has been added to the Console UI just to make it look more like the real thing. I may also say that `1.16.200` fixed some bugs as
well, unfortunately old versions no more than `1.16.200` will not work and will bug a lot. (please do not make any issues of these saying it
would not work on the older versions)

**New Feaures added/Fixed**
- Added a white transparent screen (makes it looks like console)
- Replaced the original Minecraft title to "Minecraft Console Edition"
- New background displaying on the Menu Starup
- Skin issue now fixed by 1.16.200
- Loading screen displaying while entering on worlds, realms or Servers
- All Inventories (e.g. Furnace & chest) now displaying on new stuff for Blast Furnace and other new blocks
